# Partial combinatory algebras

See [the license](LICENSE.md) for copyright information.

A [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org) formalization of [partial combinatory algebras](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/partial+combinatory+algebra) on top of [mathlib4](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4).

The project is part of the course [Formalized mathematics and proof assistants](https://www.andrej.com/zapiski/MAT-FORMATH-2024/book/00-introduction.html), taught by [Andrej Bauer](https://www.andrej.com/) in the Fall of 2024 at the [Faculty of mathematics and physics](https://www.fmf.uni-lj.si/sl/), [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si). It serves as a model project for the class projects by the students. Hopefully, it will also turn out to be useful more widely.
